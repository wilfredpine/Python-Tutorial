    "- Variable names can contain only `letters`, `numbers`, and `underscores`. They can `start with a letter or an underscore`, but `not with a number`. For instance, you can call a variable `message_1` but not `1_message`.\n",
    "- `Spaces` are not allowed in variable names, but `underscores` can be used to separate words in variable names. For example, `greeting_message` works, but `greeting message` will cause errors.\n",
    "- Avoid using Python `keywords` and `function names` as variable names; that is, do not use words that Python has `reserved` for a particular programmatic purpose, such as the word `print`. You will learn Python Keywords and Built-in Functions on other lessons.\n",
    "- Variable names should be short but descriptive. For example, `name` is better than `n`, `student_name` is better than `s_n`, and `name_length` is better than `length_of_persons_name`.\n",
    "- Be careful when using the lowercase letter `l` and the uppercase letter `O` because they could be confused with the numbers `1` and `0`.\n"
